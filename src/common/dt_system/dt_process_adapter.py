"""
Adapter: dt RoundNode tree -> minimal NetworkX ProcessGraph for ILPScheduler.

This builds a tiny structure with the same surface the ILPScheduler expects:
- .G: nx.DiGraph with nodes carrying 'parents' and 'children' lists
- .role_schemas: optional dict (unused here)

Only AdvanceNode leaves are materialized as process nodes. RoundNode schedule
is encoded as dependency edges between the boundary leaves of child subtrees:
- sequential/interleave: linearizes children left-to-right
- parallel: leaves independent across children

Nested RoundNodes are handled recursively. This provides enough structure for
ILPScheduler to compute ASAP/ALAP levels, lifespans and an interference graph
that you can use as metadata for a higher-level simulation graph.
