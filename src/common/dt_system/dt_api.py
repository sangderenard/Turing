"""Hierarchical timestep control API.

Each simulation component maintains its own adaptive controller. A parent
regulator proposes a timestep based on its metric and instructs its
subordinates to advance by that amount. Subordinates may satisfy the
request by executing multiple micro-steps using their own controller. The
process is strictly top-downâ€”there is **no global negotiation** of the
step size.

The :class:`~src.cells.bath.dt_controller.STController` implements this
policy. Components that wish to expose a uniform interface can conform to
:class:`DtStepper`, which accepts a :class:`~src.common.dt.SuperstepPlan`
and returns a :class:`~src.common.dt.SuperstepResult` after covering the
requested window.
