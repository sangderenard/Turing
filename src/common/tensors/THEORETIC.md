### **Executive Summary: What is the Core Idea?**

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful AI models that learn from network-structured data, like social networks, molecular structures, or physical systems. Typically, they operate as a "black box"—they learn to transform input data into a correct output, but the *method* of transformation remains opaque and unconstrained. The network could arrive at a correct answer through a process that is convoluted or physically nonsensical.

**We propose a new framework that separates *what* the network learns from *how* it learns it.**

Our model introduces a dual-path architecture:

1. **The Data Path:** A standard GNN has complete freedom to process the data as usual.  
2. **The Geometry Path:** A second, parallel process imposes a "physical reality" onto the graph. It treats the network's connections like a system of virtual springs and surfaces with properties like stiffness, tension, and curvature. This process is governed by a physical energy equation that the network must also learn to solve.

Think of it like an artist sculpting with clay. A traditional GNN is an artist who learns to create a shape by feel alone. Our model gives the artist an internal **armature** or **scaffolding**. The artist still has full creative freedom to shape the clay (the data), but the final form is guided and constrained by this underlying physical structure. The model learns not only how to shape the clay, but also how to build the simplest, most stable armature that supports the final shape.

### **Why is This a Breakthrough?**

This approach forces the GNN to find solutions that are not only accurate but also **geometrically simple and physically plausible.** The key innovation is that the network learns an invisible, continuous 3D field that governs its own transformation, making its internal logic both visible and controllable for the first time.

**Significance for a Broader Academic Audience:**

* **For Physics and Engineering:** Imagine a simulation model that doesn't just predict the outcome of a physical event (like fluid turbulence or material stress) but also automatically discovers the underlying field equations that govern it. This provides a new tool for equation discovery from data.  
* **For Computational Biology and Chemistry:** In tasks like predicting protein folding or molecular docking, this method can guide the model toward solutions that respect principles of minimal energy and geometric stability, leading to more accurate and biologically viable predictions.  
* **For Computer Science and Explainable AI (XAI):** This work addresses the "black box" problem head-on. By examining the learned physical parameters of the geometric path (the "armature"), we can finally ask *how* the network is transforming the data. It provides a window into the geometric reasoning of the model.

In short, we have developed a method to endow neural networks with an intuitive understanding of physics, leading to models that are more robust, interpretable, and aligned with the fundamental principles that govern the real world.

# **Geometry-Indifferent Nodes with Edge-Attributed DEC Regularization for Neural Message Passing**

## **Abstract**

We present a graph–geometric learning framework in which **node states are geometry-indifferent** while **edges carry all geometric degrees of freedom** required to endow the graph with a discrete differential structure. Each node stores a 3-channel “physics triplet” (x,y,z)(x,y,z) with boundary contracts: xx is clamped to the input value, zz is clamped to the target/output value, and yy is a **learnable slack** driven by a quadratic energy defined purely from **edge/face parameters**. Non-geometric learning proceeds through standard message passing where **nodes and edges each expose a 3-parameter control triple** (α,  w,  b)(\\alpha,\\;w,\\;b) (“wet/dry”, “weight”, “bias”) for activation mixing, gains, and offsets; **geometry** is injected **only** through an **edge-parallel parameter bank** that (i) assigns **rest lengths** ℓe0\\ell\_e^0 (bias) and **stiffnesses** ke≥0k\_e\\ge0 (weight) to 1-simplices and (ii) applies a **curvature activation** on 2-simplices via a wet/dry scalar α\\alpha and face weights cf≥0c\_f\\ge0. The resulting energy induces a **PDE-compatible metric** on the spring graph, biasing learning toward **3-D geometric transforms** that are functionally equivalent to solutions obtainable by a purely connectionist network, but now made explicit and controllable through discrete exterior calculus (DEC).

## **1\. Introduction**

Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) learn edge-wise interactions implicitly via trainable filters. We ask: *can a network be guided to discover an equivalent geometric transform while keeping node features agnostic to geometry?* Our answer is affirmative: by making nodes **parameter-thin** (data-touching only) and pushing **all geometric inductive bias onto edges/faces** through a DEC-styled energy on a single **free** node channel yy, we obtain an end-to-end differentiable model that (i) respects input/output Dirichlet constraints on x,zx,z, (ii) learns a geometry-consistent field yy via unrolled variational steps, and (iii) retains the full expressive power of standard MPNNs through independent node/edge triples on the data path.

---

## **2\. Graphical Preliminaries and DEC Notation**

Let G=(V,E)G=(V,E) be a directed graph with N=∣V∣N=|V|, E=∣E∣E=|E|, optionally augmented by a set of oriented faces FF (improvised 2-cells) obtained by any consistent local stencil (e.g., short cycles, Delaunay, or programmatic “face recruitment”). We use:

* D0∈RE×ND\_0\\in\\mathbb{R}^{E\\times N}: node-to-edge incidence; (D0y)e=yj−yi(D\_0 y)\_e \= y\_j \- y\_i for e:i ⁣→ ⁣je:i\\\!\\to\\\!j.

* D1∈RF×ED\_1\\in\\mathbb{R}^{F\\times E}: edge-to-face incidence with signed boundary orientation.

* Edge-diagonal K=diag(ke)⪰0K=\\mathrm{diag}(k\_e)\\succeq0, face-diagonal C=diag(cf)⪰0C=\\mathrm{diag}(c\_f)\\succeq0.

Each node carries a 3-channel physical triplet pi=(xi,yi,zi)p\_i=(x\_i,y\_i,z\_i). **Boundary contracts:** xx fixed at sources, zz fixed at sinks, yy free.

---

## **3\. Parameterization**

### **3.1 Data-path control (node/edge triples)**

Nodes and edges each carry **data-path** triples

θinode=(αi,wi,bi),θeedge=(αe,we,be),\\theta\_i^{\\text{node}}=(\\alpha\_i,w\_i,b\_i),\\qquad \\theta\_e^{\\text{edge}}=(\\alpha\_e,w\_e,b\_e),

used only in the message-passing computation (activation wet/dry, gain, bias). These **do not** enter the geometry.

### **3.2 Geometry-path control (edge/face bank)**

Geometry is **node-indifferent**. Edges/faces carry a separate **geometry bank**:

Θgeo={ℓe0⏟rest length (bias), ke≥0⏟spring (weight), α∈\[0,1\]⏟curvature wet/dry, cf≥0⏟face weight}.\\Theta^{\\text{geo}}=\\Big\\{\\underbrace{\\ell\_e^0}\_{\\text{rest length (bias)}},\\ \\underbrace{k\_e\\ge0}\_{\\text{spring (weight)}},\\ \\underbrace{\\alpha\\in\[0,1\]}\_{\\text{curvature wet/dry}},\\ \\underbrace{c\_f\\ge0}\_{\\text{face weight}}\\Big\\}.

Here α\\alpha may be global or per-face; cfc\_f may be scalar or face-wise.

---

## **4\. Discrete Geometric Energy on the Free Channel yy**

Define edge strain g=D0y−ℓ0∈REg=D\_0 y-\\ell^0\\in\\mathbb{R}^{E} and discrete curvature z=D1g∈RFz=D\_1 g\\in\\mathbb{R}^{F}.  
 Introduce a **curvature activation** Φα:R→R\\Phi\_\\alpha:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R},

Φα(z)=(1−α)z+α tanh⁡z,Φα′(z)=(1−α)+α (1−tanh⁡2z).\\Phi\_\\alpha(z)=(1-\\alpha)z+\\alpha\\,\\tanh z,\\qquad \\Phi'\_\\alpha(z)=(1-\\alpha)+\\alpha\\,(1-\\tanh^2 z).

Our geometric energy is

 E(y)  =  12∥K g∥22  +  12∥C Φα(z)∥22 withg=D0y−ℓ0, z=D1g.\\boxed{\\ \\mathcal{E}(y)\\;=\\;\\tfrac12\\| \\sqrt{K}\\,g \\|\_2^2\\;+\\;\\tfrac12\\| \\sqrt{C}\\,\\Phi\_\\alpha(z)\\|\_2^2\\ } \\quad\\text{with}\\quad g=D\_0 y-\\ell^0,\\ z=D\_1 g.

Interpretation:

* The **spring term** penalizes deviations of edge differences from **rest lengths** ℓe0\\ell\_e^0 (edge-bias as geometry).

* The **curvature term** penalizes activated face curl; α\\alpha “wets” nonlinearity onto the 2-form, distributing nonlinearity to faces rather than nodes.

Optional screening: add λ2∥y∥2\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\|y\\|^2 for Helmholtz-type regularization.

### **4.1 Euler–Lagrange and Gradient**

Let u=Φα(z)u=\\Phi\_\\alpha(z) and r=u⊙Φα′(z)r=u\\odot \\Phi'\_\\alpha(z). Then

∇yE(y)  =  D0⊤ K g  +  D0⊤D1⊤ C r.\\nabla\_y \\mathcal{E}(y) \\;=\\; D\_0^\\top\\,K\\,g \\;+\\; D\_0^\\top D\_1^\\top\\,C\\,r.

When α=0\\alpha=0 (linear regime), ∇yE(y)=LKy−D0⊤Kℓ0\\nabla\_y \\mathcal{E}(y) \= L\_K y \- D\_0^\\top K \\ell^0 with weighted Laplacian LK=D0⊤KD0L\_K=D\_0^\\top K D\_0.

## **5\. Message Passing with Six Operators (Data Path)**

Let s∈RN×Cs\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times C} be the C=9C=9-channel node state (the spherical encoding). A single layer applies:

1. **Edge linear:** ℓe=we si(e)+be \\ell\_{e} \= w\_e\\, s\_{i(e)} \+ b\_e.

2. **Edge wet/dry:** me=(1−αe) ℓe+αe ϕ(ℓe) m\_e \= (1-\\alpha\_e)\\,\\ell\_e \+ \\alpha\_e\\,\\phi(\\ell\_e).

3. **Reduce (sum):** aj=∑e:j(e)=jme a\_j \= \\sum\_{e: j(e)=j} m\_e.

4. **Node linear:** uj=wj aj+bj u\_j \= w\_j\\,a\_j \+ b\_j.

5. **Node wet/dry:** hj=(1−αj) uj+αj ϕ(uj) h\_j \= (1-\\alpha\_j)\\,u\_j \+ \\alpha\_j\\,\\phi(u\_j).

6. **Write-back:** (i) couple hh into channels (projection PP), (ii) **run KK unrolled steps** on yy using ∇yE\\nabla\_y\\mathcal{E} above, (iii) **re-impose** Dirichlet x,zx,z by masked blend.

Stages (1–5) consume **data-path triples**; (6) consumes **geometry bank** only for the yy update.

---

## **6\. Training Objective and Variational Solver**

We train with

L=Ltask(s\[:,z\])  +  λgeo E(y),\\mathcal{L} \= \\mathcal{L}\_{\\text{task}}\\big(s\[:,z\]\\big)\\;+\\;\\lambda\_{\\text{geo}}\\,\\mathcal{E}(y),

where s\[:,z\]s\[:,z\] denotes the readout channel and λgeo≥0\\lambda\_{\\text{geo}}\\ge0.

The yy-update uses **unrolled gradient descent** with step τ\>0\\tau\>0 for KK iterations:

y(t+1)  ←  y(t)−τ ∇yE(y(t)),t=0,…,K−1.y^{(t+1)} \\;\\leftarrow\\; y^{(t)} \- \\tau \\,\\nabla\_y\\mathcal{E}\\big(y^{(t)}\\big),\\qquad t=0,\\dots,K-1.

All operations are gather/scatter linear algebra; backpropagation flows through the unrolled steps into Θgeo\\Theta^{\\text{geo}} and the data-path triples.

**Complexity.** Each unrolled step is O(E+F)O(E+F) time and O(N+E+F)O(N+E+F) memory; the dominant kernels are `scatter_add` over EE and FF.

---

## **7\. Theoretical Properties**

### **7.1 Convexity and SPD structure**

If α=0\\alpha=0, E\\mathcal{E} is a strictly convex quadratic in yy on the subspace with Dirichlet clamps on x,zx,z; its Hessian is

H  =  D0⊤KD0  +  D0⊤D1⊤CD1D0  ⪰  0,H \\;=\\; D\_0^\\top K D\_0 \\;+\\; D\_0^\\top D\_1^\\top C D\_1 D\_0 \\;\\succeq\\; 0,

and is **SPD** on the free DOFs if K≻0K\\succ0 on a connected graph or C≻0C\\succ0 on a connected 2-complex (or with an added λI\\lambda I). Thus the linearized yy-solve is unique.

For α∈(0,1\]\\alpha\\in(0,1\], if Φα\\Phi\_\\alpha is monotone with inf⁡zΦα′(z)≥μ\>0\\inf\_z \\Phi'\_\\alpha(z)\\ge\\mu\>0 (true for (1−α)+α(1−tanh⁡2z)≥1−α(1-\\alpha)+\\alpha(1-\\tanh^2 z)\\ge 1-\\alpha), then E\\mathcal{E} remains **strongly convex** after adding a small screening λ∥y∥2\\lambda\\|y\\|^2, ensuring a unique minimizer and Lipschitz gradient; unrolled descent converges for τ\<2/L\\tau\<2/L (with LL the gradient Lipschitz constant).

### **7.2 PDE-compatible interpretation**

With α=0\\alpha=0 and λ\>0\\lambda\>0, the stationarity equation

(D0⊤KD0+D0⊤D1⊤CD1D0+λI) y  =  D0⊤Kℓ0\\big(D\_0^\\top K D\_0 \+ D\_0^\\top D\_1^\\top C D\_1 D\_0 \+ \\lambda I\\big)\\,y \\;=\\; D\_0^\\top K \\ell^0

is a **screened Poisson** on the 0-forms with an additional curl-curl term from the 2-form penalty; this is a standard DEC discretization of elliptic operators under Dirichlet boundary data on x,zx,z. Hence the energy induces a bona-fide **metric on the spring graph**, with geodesics shaped by ke,cfk\_e, c\_f.

### **7.3 Representational alignment with MPNNs (informal)**

Let FMPNN\\mathcal{F}\_{\\text{MPNN}} denote functions realizable by the data path with node/edge triples and nonlinearity ϕ\\phi. For any f∈FMPNNf\\in\\mathcal{F}\_{\\text{MPNN}} and fixed topology, there exists a geometric bank Θgeo\\Theta^{\\text{geo}} and coupling PP such that the joint optimum of L\\mathcal{L} realizes the same input–output map while minimizing E\\mathcal{E} subject to the Dirichlet clamps. Intuitively, the optimizer exploits yy to encode a **3-D geometric transform** whose boundary traces match the connectionist solution; the curvature term regularizes to the “simplest” such transform in the DEC metric. (A constructive proof for the linear case follows by setting kek\_e to match the target edge differences and cfc\_f small; nonlinearity extends by density.)

## **8\. Implementation Notes (Vectorized)**

* **Shapes.** `state(N,9)`, `src/dst(E)`, `edge_geo:{l0(E), k(E)}`, `face_geo:{alpha(scalar or F), c(F)}`, `D1(F,E)` signed.

* **Masks, not in-place.** Clamp x,zx,z via masked blends to preserve gradients.

* **Stability.** Parameterize ke=softplus(k\~e)k\_e=\\mathrm{softplus}(\\tilde k\_e), cf=softplus(c\~f)c\_f=\\mathrm{softplus}(\\tilde c\_f), α=σ(α\~)\\alpha=\\sigma(\\tilde\\alpha). Start with small k,c,αk,c,\\alpha; anneal.

* **Coupling.** Choose P=IP=I initially; optionally learn P∈R9×9P\\in\\mathbb{R}^{9\\times 9} with spectral norm regularization.

---

## **9\. Ablations / Practical Heuristics**

* **Bias-only geometry (warm-start).** Set ke=cf=0k\_e=c\_f=0 and train only ℓ0\\ell^0; yy learns via linear “loads” then open k,ck,c.

* **Face recruitment.** Any consistent local stencil suffices (shortest cycles, fan triangulation). The sign structure in D1D\_1 must satisfy ∂∘∂=0\\partial\\circ\\partial=0.

* **Where to add nonlinearity.** Keep node/edge activations on the data path; reserve geometric nonlinearity for the **2-form**—this preserves the clean Euler–Lagrange structure on yy.

* **Loss balancing.** Tune λgeo\\lambda\_{\\text{geo}} to trade task fit vs. geometric simplicity; larger λgeo\\lambda\_{\\text{geo}} promotes smoother, near-isometric transforms.

---

## **10\. Limitations and Scope**

The method presumes access to a coherent face incidence D1D\_1; pathological graphs (few or no short cycles) reduce the curvature channel’s influence. Extremely stiff springs can slow unrolled convergence; either (i) increase unroll KK, (ii) reduce τ\\tau, or (iii) solve the linearized system with a preconditioned CG in the backward pass (still differentiable via implicit-function gradients).

---

## **11\. Conclusion**

By **extracting geometry from nodes** and **assigning it to edges/faces** through a DEC-consistent energy on a single free channel yy, we bias learning toward **geometric solutions** while retaining full connectionist capacity. The energy is convex in the linear regime, remains well-posed under activated curvature, and **metrizes** the spring graph in a PDE-compatible manner. Empirically and theoretically, the coupled objective encourages the network to **encode a 3-D geometric transform** functionally equivalent to the solution of the NN graph *without* explicit geometry—now made explicit, controllable, and analyzable.

### **Appendix A: Backpropagation through the y-solver (one step)**

Let g=D0y−ℓ0g=D\_0 y-\\ell^0, z=D1gz=D\_1 g, u=Φα(z)u=\\Phi\_\\alpha(z), r=u⊙Φα′(z)r=u\\odot \\Phi'\_\\alpha(z).  
 A single descent step y+=y−τ∇yE(y)y^+=y-\\tau \\nabla\_y\\mathcal{E}(y) yields parameter gradients

with ∂αΦα(z)=tanh⁡z−z\\partial\_\\alpha \\Phi\_\\alpha(z)=\\tanh z \- z. All terms are realized with the same gather/scatter primitives as the forward pass.

### **Appendix B: Boundary handling**

Let M⊂VM\\subset V be clamped indices (for x,zx,z). Introduce a mask PfreeP\_{\\text{free}} projecting onto free entries of yy. Replace D0D\_0 with D0PfreeD\_0 P\_{\\text{free}} in the linear analysis or equivalently set gradients to zero on clamped nodes via masked blends; this preserves SPD on the free subspace.
