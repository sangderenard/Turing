each parameter has a wheel:


-- input --
a b c d e f
-- pre mix --
g h i j k l
-- data frequency sorting --
1 2 3 4 5 6 <-- as a demonstration and for curiosity, this is a spectral binning layer
-- post mix --
m n o p q r

--output features--
s t u v w x
@ # $ % ^ & <-- not fed by the last row, fed by the binning layer as the fft output of the history of phi values per node
                not fully connected but parallel wired to 1 2 3 4 5 6, processed at any time, a second output layer

fft window = history = wheel size

wheels: 

ring buffers used in many places:

* parameters are on wheels, each place on the parameter wheel, or any wheel, is tick number + row number % fft window
* phi values are on wheels for the spectral binning layer and the output layer
spectral binning layer:

normalize by frequencies present in the history of phi values over time of the nodes
one wheel per node, recording phi values in a history 

1 lowest band
...
6 highest band

1 connects to @, 6 to &, in the above diagram, with single edges, this is an "extra" process, a fork
it is still open to design ideas how to handle forking with pump tick, which performs all steps at once in every tick

pump tick:

all edges share a common operation sequence, as do all nodes. Because of this, each tick:
* every single edge function is handled at once in a vectorized operation over the required operations
* every node then performs the same operation sequence
* this consequentially means that at any given time once the window is filled, there are window length live processes inside the network

ONE TICK = ONE BATCH
((alpha * activation(in) + (1-alpha) * in) * weight + bias)

THE WINDOW SIZE IS LARGER THAN THE NETWORK, THEREFOR, BACKPROP AND OUTPUT LOSS WILL NOT BE SYNCHRONOUS
THIS NECESSITATES A LOSS/JVP WHEEL BUFFERING TO JVP/BACKPROP

*FREEZE PARAM VALUES ON WHEELS, IMPRESSION FINISHED*

forward inference:

param wheel turns as each input is taken as a row entry in a stream, using it's stored value, creating a forward pass that is as long as the fft window was before parameter patterns repeat
