# ASCII Diff Package

This package provides a minimal copy of the image-to-ASCII pipeline from the `timesync` clock demo.
It includes an `AsciiKernelClassifier`, a `PixelFrameBuffer`, and drawing helpers for diff-based rendering.

Run the demo to display a flipped image diff:

```bash
python ascii_diff/demo.py
```
