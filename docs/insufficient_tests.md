# Tests Removed for Insufficient Coverage

The following tests were removed because they were tautological and could not fail, providing no meaningful coverage:

- `tests/test_fast_console_format.py` - the test concluded with `assert True`.
- `tests/test_fast_console_escape_sequences.py` - the test concluded with `assert True`.

These tests are marked as insufficient and have been removed.
